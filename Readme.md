Mobile Forces Source
====================

This is the source code of Mobile Forces Source xD
And apparently the MFS Wiki xD

the source code of MFS is in the SourceCode\mp dirrectory, and the folder structure is like this:
mobileforcessource
		|
		>>>>>bin(the compiled client.dll/dylib/so and server.dll/dylib/so go here after their compiled)
SourceCode>>>>>mp
		|
		>>>>>game(the default game folder you would get with the source sdk)
		>>>>>src(contains the solutions and other folders)
		|	|
		|	|>>>>>DirrectX(Dirrect X SDK, which could be used for shaders and flash)
		|	|>>>>>fmod(contains the fmod files xD, pretty obvious)
		|	|>>>>>game(contrains most of the important code)
		|		|>>>>>client(contains client-side files obvious xD))
		|			|>>>>>hl2dm(client-side hl2dm code, which mfs uses mostly instead of the code in the hl2 and sdk folders)
		|		|>>>>>server((contains server-side files obvious xD))
		|			|>>>>>hl2dm(server-side hl2dm code, which mfs uses mostly instead of the code in the hl2 and sdk folders)
		|		|>>>>>shared(has files that are shared betwean them, obvious xD)
		|			|>>>>>hl2dm(shared hl2dm code, which mfs uses mostly instead of the code in the hl2 and sdk folders)
		>>>>>createallprojects/.bat>Used to create the solutions
		>>>>>creategameprojects/.bat>^
there are lots of more folders but im lazy to write now :P

to compile the everything(game+tools) solution create it using mp\src\createallprojects/.bat
to compile the game(4 most important solutions) solution create it using mp\src\creategameprojects/.bat
to compile shaders edit the mp\src\materialsystem\stdshaders\buildmyshaders.bat and use that
Note: after the projects finish generating, add ";..\..\fmod\api\lib;..\..\DirrectX\Lib" to the additional Library dirrectories for the Client Project :P because idk where is that list in VPC
also change them from Debug to Release lol cuz for now idk to make them Release by default :P
p.s xD: particles_manifest.txt contains some particles and commented links to some articles that could prove useful, but i was eather too lazy to implement it, or i dont see a purpose to it now

If you're looking for the mfs story... check out mfs.txt but dont say i didint warn you about the spoilers and that it could change over time xD
Feel free to make even the smallest changes that make the game better ^^
