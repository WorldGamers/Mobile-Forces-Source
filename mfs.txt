MFS Story

In the MFS Story the player chooses his own squad, Blue or Red. The two squads become rivals
After the palyer has several times gone against the opposing squad the player Realises that the other squad isnt that bad and that the both of them pratically share the same opinion about everything
(but both would like to be the top dog squad and finds the other squad evil) While Going on missions and Digging up for info,
The player Unlocks background info and learns secrets and later even achieves god-like abilities Due to his knowgledge and personality
(but nowone knew exactly where did thoose ablities come from because they arent allways active).
The Player unites the two squads and leads them to a place which he had dreams, nightmares, some place which the player wasnt even sure that exists...
but it was destiny to unite the two squads and go there...

Storyline:

===beggining===
The player(a teen who applied for the army xD(because he/she :O is a saiyan troll)) arrives at the army, and meets two army recruiters... 1 of them is from the Blue army and the other is from the Red army.
The player has a choice to talk to both of them and see what their squad is like(tho their both pretty much the same) and decide which one to pick, or to just instantly pick a squad without thinking.
After choosing a Squad the player goes all like FCK Yeah im a teen in the army and goes off the tell all his/her ;p troll friends etc. *Background Blacks out*
*The player has a pretty epic dream* and wakes up to see that he/she is gonna be late, hurrys off to the army where he expects to have his first army style training and simulation of a mission

Immortal Troll:

of trollness into combat and the ultiamte evil was... ultimatively defeated xD by your awesome op'ness( with the help of your friends ofc ;, oh who am i kidding it was ur opness :P) )

Super Soldier
Wind Style Rasen Shuriken !!!!<Note:No there wont actually be a rasen shuriken :(<i had to put this note here because of copyright lol,

I was wrong
the player becomes a demi-god... but gets corrupted by evil... and basically starts killing everyone,
in the end the player achieves almost perfection and everyone who is still alive gathers around to kill him/her
while for half of that battle the player seem un-beatable...and the player is like IDIOTS, MORTALS< I AM A GOD NOW... tho not the good kind but you get defeated by a higher force...
friendship, and that blow took u down... u realize u are wrong about friendship and power but its too late...You use your last bit of strenght to revive the people u killed and her final words(until MFS2 xD) are...
im sorry, it ends like this... i was wrong
^
todo:Write about how they sacrificed themselfs in the most omg way to stop him... and that he revived them all and didint die like a vilian


There may be a couple of things in the acutal game not mentioned here xD

easter egg endings:

Die DIe DIEEEE!!!XD(Happends if you help the magestic dude and fail at defeating the boss(if you arent the boss lol)):
the player gets defeated by the boss...
but thanks to the fact he/she did the optonal quest to help 1 magestic dude...
which you helped earlier he appears otu of nowhere and is like Wind StYLE: RASEN SHURIKEEEN !!!
and aims it at the boss... and all of the sudden the player sees the WTFFFF KA BOOOOM HUHHHHEH HEHEHEHEH thing XD
and he is like i said i was gonna repay you xD... and then we kiss we hug and everyone is happy,
and the player continues being stronger and stronger and get a vision of the time when he/she will become a god

Rape Hatsune Miku(happends if you give a fck bout everything else and rape miku xD):
While everyone is at war... fighting the evil boss... the camera switches to a scene where you start to rape miku or something XD *censored*... the end?... cuz you dont give a fuck about anything else than raping miku? XD

if you helped the magestic guy:
{
he will appear in the ending eather way
}

Stuff to put in MFS:
hope can come from anywhere
a epic moment where the palyer will be with 9 hp vs a ultimate evil boss saying.... "... IM GoNa WIN THIS BATttlE!!!" with some epic music trumumtrtr trtrrtimmmrrr !!, soon the player would become practically immortal after the ultimate evil boss tries to attack you xD(but you still have to survive till it attacks lol xD)
two troll drug lords found in some map
a epic time paradox where the player sees some news from the past and he thinks what kind of idiot would do this XD, later he time travels for hte lolz and finds out that he did that XD
