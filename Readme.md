This is the source code of Mobile Forces Source xD (and apparently the MFS wiki)
 
The folder structure is like this: 

###### Mobile-Forces-Source

|	|>>>>mobileforcessource 

|		|>>>>bin - the client.dll/dylib/so and server.dll/dylib/so go here after being compiled 

|>>>>src - contains the solutions when they are generated alongside various engine things lol 

	|>>>>fmod - contains fmod related files, pretty obvious xD 
	
	|>>>>game - most of the code which will show up in-game and decide how shit works 
	
	|	|>>>>client - contains client-side files 
	
	|	|	|>>>>hl2dm - client-side hl2dm code, multiplayer base 
	
	|	|>>>>server - contains server-side files 
	
	|	|	|>>>>hl2dm - server-side hl2dm code, multiplayer base 
	
	|	|>>>>shared(has files that are shared betwean the client and server, lots of voodoo 
	
	|		|>>>>hl2dm(shared hl2dm code, the voodoo that that comes with the multiplayer base 
	
	|>>>>materialsystem

	|>>>>creategameprojects/.bat - Used to create the solution for everything that can be modded 
	
there are lots of more folders but im lazy to write now :P 

for the time being i dont know how to make vpc create projects that are in the release config by default so change them 
from Debug to Release lol 
 
If you're looking for the mfs story... check out mfs.txt but that hasn't been updated in ages and prolly will change :P
Feel free to make any changes that could make the game better ^^
