there are lots of more folders but im lazy to write now :P 

for the time being i dont know how to make vpc create projects that are in the release config by default so change them 
from Debug to Release lol 
 
If you're looking for the mfs story... check out mfs.txt but that hasn't been updated in ages and prolly will change :P
Feel free to make any changes that could make the game better ^^
