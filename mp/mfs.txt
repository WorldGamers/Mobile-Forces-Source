Once on foot, everybody gather up in 4 lines (8 soldiers in each line) and [other soldier who were already there start bullying new recruits..."fresh meat arrived, boys !" and stuff like that]. Sgt. Patrick (Heywood's guy) comes [with a clipboard in hand] and starts talking ["Welcome to (name of division) base (ask filip), I am Sgt. Patrick and I will be your fucking tour guide. Before we start, we will form groups....Sgt. Patrick takes out 4 small squared shaped colored cards (Blue, red, green and yellow) and starts shuffeling like poker cards"] (starts calling each soldier one by one and slaps a card on their arm)

PATRICK SAYS "THIS WILL BE YOUR PLAYGROUND" (and one of the frisbee guy crashes in new recruits and Sgt. Patrick says "Watch yourself, private !")**

Sgt. will take new recruits to the training ground where every soldier will be tested for strenght, speed, stamina and distraction etc

**some soldiers will be left behind because of low stamina and eventually thrown out** 

*[Playable]*

Once you complete the course, Sgt. Patrick will take you inside big hanger where you can see 2 soldiers fist-fighting in a ring and others are watching them fight...(*Sgt. Patrick says "interested in hand-to-hand combat, are we ?"*)(you get close to them) One of them is big and looks bad-ass and he is teaching him how to fight when you have no weapons (soldier tries to punch the big guy and he blocks his attack and throws him on the ground and big guy says "Hurts, doesn't it ?"....Big guy looks behind *Heywood's description: bladecut on left eye (from forehead to cheek), goatee, flat-top haircut, angry eyes* {cutscene...as camera shows Heywood, it stops and shows name of Heywood in scene} and says "Well, hello maggots" laying soldier gets angry and tries to attack big guy from behind but he still grabs him by his arm and knocks him out with one punch and says to the other group (which was already there) "Never take your eye off your opponent" *2 guys from group pick up the knocked-out soldier and take him out of ring (trying to get him back in concious)*
Heywood lights cigar (like duke nukem) and  Sgt. Patrick gets inside the ring to talk to Heywood

Heywood takes clipboard from Sgt. Patrick and starts looking at names and stops at McCoys...

(Heywood to Sgt. Patrick (audible whispering) >> brothers ?)

Sgt. Patrick: (replies in whisper too) Yes...

Heywood: Hmm...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heywood throws clipboard on the table (outside of ring) and tells Hank and Jake to join them (Heywood and Patrick) in the ring

Heywood: You two, get in.....(once they get in) think of it as a TeamDeath Match. You 2 vs Me and Sargent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heywood picks his hands up for Hank to hit target (Heywood's palm) and Patrick does the same for Jake

Heywood: (bully-ish voice) As hard as you can now....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Press Left-Click to punch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heywood: Come ooon, 5th grader can punch harder than you (hits Hank)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Again "Left-Click"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heywood: What, mom doesn't feed her baby enough (ask filip for correct line) (hits Hank again)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hank gets angry and hits Heywood but not strong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heywood: Ooouu, come on kitty kat ! hit me !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hank hits but Heywood hits Hank
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hank get angrier and lands a powerful punch but Heywood didn't get hurt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heywood: Oh, it's on now baby boy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heywood punchs Hank several times and Hank is hurt (low health)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hank lands a powerful punch in Heywood's face and Heywood sits down on one knee with his face down because he's bleeding from mouth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bell rings...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heywood stops fighting and gets up slowly

Heywood: Nice fight, soldier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hank and Jake get out of ring but Heywood and Patrick stay

everybody starts walking

Heywood to Patrick: I felt it in them...let's hope they are actually them
Patrick: (like Judge Dredd) Yeah !

Heywood pats Patrick on shoulder

red
:
== same continuation for blue
Gets hired to defeat Gabriel, an evil priest who wants to rebirth the world. The player is shown an ancient prophecy picture of how a special soldier comes to banish evil. Characters are semi aware of being in a computer world, sometimes call the player "special" and for being from the prophecy. the player never actually sees Gabriel doing something wrong but is told about it by his "former teacher", the high priest. Some time ahead the player gets captured by Gabriel and tries to attack him only to find out Gabriel is a type of demi-god, and  he says while blocking bullets or whatever(prolly cut scene) that the player is special, and is indeed for now the only thing that can stop him but that soon he will ascend beyond the level of the player and rule the game, to which the player is confused. Player escapes and eventually Gets to a place where Gabriel is starting his ascension, has a talk on how for far too long the world was ruled by simple mechanics and no free choices, but that a bug appeared in this exact spot and that his programming had no way to respond, it was blank and that his free will born from that and that now he's trully gonna be free. Player fails to stop the ascension and Bot Gabriel is added on top of npc Gabriel, boasts how he has gained the powers of and surpassed the player and is the new god of that world, soon that he will know whats the true meaning of it and whats beyond his world. To kill gabriel he has to be killed twice, before the bot him can respawn on top of the npc him, an epic fight starts but proves impossible and Gabriel uses cheat commands and all sorts of hacks, if the player dies early MFS crashes and gabriel "took it over", if not gabriel gets beaten down to npc mode only and chained by a special unpredicted weapon and by usage of a same console computer bug that was used to evolve him to a bot. Player sees comrades and the high priest comming from a distance and Gabriel starts to moan how his life's work is over, how he will never know and how he knew he would get beaten down but tried to escape fate and live free. With gabriel tied up on ur left side theres a knife and the console computer on the right. "This just doesnt feel right" and if the player goes to the pc, s secret ending and achievement starts, the player summons gabriel as a bot again and he gets suprised.. If not grabs the knife and stabs while a freeze moment with a tear coming from his eyes happends, if the player does nothing the ppl come and Gabriel is just in his npc form and this happends for cases:The high priest says that Gabriel was his only nuisance and that he had to be eliminated, thanks the player but says that everything from the players world only causes trouble here and that he will plunge the world into holy darkness to rebirth it clean from filthy false god's.  Player realises the high priest was framing Gabriel who has done nothing wrong, If gabriel is alive he comments how there is no true god who is actively participating in the world they are but that the player is the hand of god, high priest says hes insane and the fight starts.. If gabriel is dead the player has like 10% chance of wining and when he loses gets a message "the lack of proper judgement has caused the end for this world" unless he uses the console thing to summon a bot only gabriel and they manage to defeat the high priest together.. Full npc and bot gabriel destroys the priest and his machinery all alone and npc gabriel behaves as the bot but weaker and when won becomes a bot too and some kind of speech starts and a cut scene starts that shows Gabriel entering the real world and seeing the sun and people, walking...
